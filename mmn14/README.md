# MMN 14 Project

File operations requests from client to a server that holds the files.
Communication was done using websockets.

This project was made using C++ for the server, Python for the client.
In addition the Boost C++ library was used for the sockets communication.

# Activation

In order to run the project you first need to have the expected non code files,
after acquiring those files and placing them in the appropriate location run the [server.cpp](/mmn14/server/server.cpp) file which activates the server.

Then run the user side found in [client.py](/mmn14/client/client.py) file.

You can then look at the files changed on the appropriate directories and the output that was printed out on your terminal/cmd.
